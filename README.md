# 3D Building Project

## Description
This project is a 3D visualization of a building built with React and [three.js](https://threejs.org/), enabling users to interact with a 3D model of the building in real-time. The application leverages Vite for fast development and bundling.

## Live demo 
- [3d-Building](https://3d-building-woad.vercel.app/)

## Features
- **Interactive 3D Building Model**: A detailed 3D model of a building that can be explored interactively.
- **Camera Controls**: Rotate, zoom, and move around the building model for a better view of its features.
- **Responsive Design**: The project is responsive, adjusting to various screen sizes to ensure a smooth experience across devices.
- **Realistic Lighting**: Dynamic lighting effects to enhance the realism of the building.
- **Texture Mapping**: Detailed textures applied to various parts of the building such as walls, windows, and doors.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A next-generation, fast build tool and development server for modern web projects.
- **three.js**: A JavaScript 3D library used to create and display 3D models in the web browser.
